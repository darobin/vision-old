        It was created based on a brainstorming breakout during Team Day 2013. It is
        an evolving, unofficial, not-particularly-sanctioned, likely-wrong-in-many-places 
        write-up of our collective thinking.

      <h2>The Web Society</h2>
      <!-- 1. The endgame of W3C is to disappear -->
      <p>
        An organisation that does not envision and continuously strive to effect a state of the
        world sufficiently aligned with its goals that it will then, having attained its endgame,
        disband and cease its activities of its own accord runs the risk of progressively renouncing
        its ambitions in order solely to perpetuate its own existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such goals may be lofty. They may be far away and hard to reach. The path leading to them
        from the present situation may be murky and strenuous, if it can be seen at all, but the
        destination must be clearly conceived for the organisation to continue applying itself
        towards their realisation and escape the drift towards a self-preservation of the means over
        the ends and its attendant bureaucracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        These goals cannot also be solely technical. Technology devoid of social embodiment is at
        best a toy; social aspirations without the technical means to deploy themselves are but
        fantasy. Technology does not create its social counterpart by fiat; and vice versa. A
        harmonious society demands that humankind's tools and laws must be crafted in unison. It is
        thus the fundamental objective of the World Wide Web Consortium to better an unfinished
        revolutionary technology in an incompletely reformed social order until this revolution is
        completed and in accord with its social correlate.

        OUTLINE
        2. Values founded in rationality
          - the things about the political technology of pre-scientific era
          - reason as the founding principle for human relations
          - this leads straight to creativity, decentralisation, lack of authority, etc. (plenty
            of material). Sustein on how dissent is critical and generative for society
          - a founding principle here is the inviolability of humans
          - why pacifism has so recently ceased to be an other-worldly aspiration...
        
        3. Emanations from the above
          - safety and privacy, the note about the NSA, about the lions
          - inclusiveness, proactively
          - see note on abundance
          - fairness. the liberal state. Adjudication
          - conservationism
        
        4. Enabling Agency
          - none of the above is possible unless we make it so
          - this is where fast, powerful programs comes in
          - "limits of their powers lie a long way this side of omniscience and omnipotence." ->
            we must be self-limited, open to revolution
          - as well as all the other values, pervasive technology
          - remove bureaucratic hurdles, both inside the organisation and outside of it (uniformity
            in law enabling greater world-class creativity). free+create impulses
          - reduce inequality in bargaining power, "the polity of pressure groups"
          - pay particular attention to "frictions and disturbances" between technology and society
            since that is where conflict need be addressed.
          - "a maxim of human association that the complexity of policy" -> simple process
        
        5. Parting Words
          - A free conspiracy to fulfil the promises of our time.
          - the whole genius of humankind
          - the higher law?
          - manifest destiny of humankind
          - the bondage of prerogative and authority, rights that can be enforced against
            magnates, majorities, and mobs.

        NOTES FROM LIPPMANN
        
        Prior to the Industrial Revolution, social relationship were relatively well ordained. The
        advent and continuous increase of the division of labour that stemmed from it was at the
        heart of all the great social issues that followed, and to this day has yet to be matched
        by a sufficient adaptation of our social thinking to our social organisation. The Web, and
        more generally the Internet, by their reticular nature have provided the soil on which to
        rebuild the links amongst people that division of labour had shaken.
        
        • "All men are persons and the human person is inviolable. Towards this conviction men have
        fought their way in the long ascent out of the morass of barbarism."
        • "The problem, as I see it, is how to reconcile with the comparatively new economy of the
        division of labour the great and ancient and progressive traditions of liberty embodied in
        laws which respect the human personality". -> this can be adapted with the Web in mind, as
        part of the intro
        • "They are, in fact, contrary to the assumptions bred in men by the whole long struggle to
        extricate conscience, intellect, labour, and personality from the bondage of prerogative,
        privilege, monopoly, authority."
        • "To establish for the individual and for voluntary associations of men rights which they
        can enforce against kings, barons, magnates, majorities, and mobs."
        • In 1937, Walter Lippmann wrote: "The current return to the authoritarian principle in 
        politics finds its principal sanction in the belief that the new machine technology requires
        the control of an omnipotent state." -> so, about the NSA thing...
        • "But the fact remains that he believes the beneficent promise of modern science can be
        realised only through the political technology of the pre-scientific ages." -> The Web is
        built on the principles of reason and modern science, it cannot be administered or 
        controlled using "the political technology of the pre-scientific ages".
        • "There is sound reasons for thinking that the laws which foster concentrated control are
        from the point of view of technological progress reactionary, that they retard it rather 
        than promote it, and that industrial laws suited to the genius of modern technology would
        vary in important respects form the laws which exist." -> adapt this and it can be served
        to justify open licenses everywhere, as well as the patent policy (and also a decrease of
        control from groups)
        • "And the limits of their powers lie a long way this side of omniscience and omnipotence."
        -> about how we ought to make sure we can fail and others can correct our mistakes. This
        could be said of WGs.
        • "Thus it is, I believe, a maxim of human association that the complexity of policy, as
        distinguished from law, must be inversely proportionate to the complexity of affairs. For
        while a few things can be directed much, many things can be administered only a little."
        -> this is about how Process should be simple, based on simple values; even though standards
        can be very intricate
        • "the polity of pressure groups" -> what we must seek to avoid
        • "That is why pacifism has so recently ceased to be an other-worldly aspiration and has
        become the working doctrine of practical men." -> I'm sure we can adapt this somehow. To
        open, good faith cooperation?
        • "For the frictions and disturbances mark the points at which the social order is in 
        conflict with the economy." -> we have some of that
        • "Since it would be as impossible for the new economy to produce wealth in an exhausted 
        land as it is for a Chinese peasant to eke out a decent living on an eroded hillside, the
        conclusion is undeniable that conservation, in its broadest sense, including the zoning of
        urban and agricultural land, is a paramount obligation of a liberal state. That anyone who
        thought he was preserving the system of free enterprise should have persuaded himself to
        to believe that the law must leave men free to destroy the patrimony of their children is
        one of the curiosities of human unreason." -> we are probably missing some form of 
        conservationism in our values. This includes making our content work hundreds of years from
        now and making sure that the resource impact of our technology is minimal.
        • "Inequality in bargaining power" -> that is something that the W3C, as a Consortium, must
        find the way to address
        • "If, as I am arguing, it is the mission of liberalism to discern the guiding principles
        of the transition from the primitive way of life in relatively self-contained communities to
        a way of life in a Great Society of interdependent specialists, then liberalism is concerned
        with nothing less than a re-adaptation of the human race to a new mode of existence."
        -> we must take that into account
        • "a revolutionary economy in an incompletely reformed social order" -> replace economy with
        technology and we're in business
        • "The kind of self-education which a self-governing people must obtain can be had only
        through its daily experiences. In other words, a democracy must have a way of life which
        educates the people for the democratic way of life." -> we need to set ourselves up so as
        to ensure that what we do is self-reproducing
        • "Truly conceived, a democracy is not the government of a people by elected representatives
        exercising the prerogatives of their former lords and masters. It is the government of the
        people by a common law which defines the reciprocal rights and duties of persons. This
        common law is defined, applies, and amended by the representatives of the people." -> can
        this somehow apply?
        • Adjudication: "Thus in a free society the state does not administer the affairs of men.
        It administers justice among men who conduct their own affairs."
        • "The manifest destiny of mankind is to become adult and to replace paternal authority
        with fraternal association." -> This seems to be part of the plan.
        • "The business of the state must be based on an understanding of the limitations of 
        coercive authority; the art of governing must call for not more than the ordinarily 
        available wisdom of average men. (...) There are few supermen. There has never been a
        succession of supermen." This is related to freedom and governance.
        • "So the liberal state does not have to be supremely wise. That is more than a state can
        hope to be: the liberal state has only to create a sincere conviction that it means to be
        fair." -> s/liberal state/Consortium/
        • "The conception of equal and certain laws is the political corollary of the division of 
        labour."
        • "There are also important differences between lions and tigers, even between African and
        Indian lions. But from the point of view of, let us say, a goat or a lamb, the common 
        characteristics of all the great carnivores are more significant than their differences."
        -> this would make a good part about infringements of privacy and security made supposedly
        in the name of democracy. There is no doubt that democracy and terrorism are different, but
        spying is spying.
        • "To those who ask where this higher law is to be found, the answer is that it is a
        progressive discovery of men striving to civilise themselves, and that its scope and 
        implications are a gradual revelation that is by no means completed." -> nice helper part
        for the section on the endgame? or maybe the conclusion?
        • "The impulse to create and the impulse to be free are cumulative: each is to the other
        both cause and effect." -> creativity
        • "Liberalism commits the destiny of civilisation, not to a few finite politicians here and
        there, but to the whole genius of mankind." -> I like "the whole genius"
        
        
        From GOOD FAITH COLLABORATION
        
        • "When those subject to bureaucratic control seek to escape the influence of the existing
        bureaucratic apparatus, this is normally possible only by creating an organization of their
        own which is equally subject to bureaucratization." 16 It seems as if Weber was speaking of
        forking over a century ago. -> yeah man
        • "In his book Surowiecki argues that groups of people can make very good decisions when
        there is diversity, independence, decentralization, and appropriate aggregation within the
        group."
        • "Some scholars even argue that Wikipedia "embodies an approximation" of philosopher Jurgen
        Habermas's notion of "rational discourse" (i.e., noncoercive, open to participation, and
        discursive)."
        • "It is true that civility as I characterize it is related to mutual respect, but there is
        a crucial difference: genuine respect is too strong a value to demand ... in a deeply
        pluralistic society. The relative advantage of civility is that it does not ask participants
        to do anything more than treat political interlocutors as if they were worthy of respect and
        understanding, keeping their private thoughts to themselves."
        • "Cass Sunstein convincingly argues that dissent is a critical and generative contribution
        to society."
