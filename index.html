      <!-- 1. The endgame of W3C is to disappear -->
      <p>
        An organisation that does not envision and continuously strive to effect a state of the
        world sufficiently aligned with its goals that it will then, having attained its endgame,
        disband and cease its activities of its own accord runs the risk of progressively renouncing
        its ambitions in order solely to perpetuate its own existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such goals may be lofty. They may be far away and hard to reach. The path leading to them
        from the present situation may be murky and strenuous, if it can be seen at all, but the
        destination must be clearly conceived for the organisation to continue applying itself
        towards their realisation and escape the drift towards a self-preservation of the means over
        the ends and its attendant bureaucracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        These goals cannot be solely technical. Technology devoid of social embodiment is at
        best a toy; social aspirations without the technical means to deploy themselves are but
        fantasy. Technology does not create its social counterpart by fiat; and vice versa. A
        harmonious society demands that humankind's tools and laws be crafted in unison. It is
        thus the fundamental objective of the World Wide Web Consortium to steward an unfinished
        revolutionary technology in an incompletely reformed social order until this revolution is
        completed and in accord with its social correlates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The principles laid out henceforth are those we believe must be those of the Web and the
        society in which it unfolds, but also those that our community must exemplify in its own
        behaviour on the way there. They are therefore meant to inform all aspects of our work be
        they technical or organisational, internal to our functioning or exposed externally through
        our contributions to the broader fora of society
      </p>
      

      <hr class='partsep'>
      <!-- 2. Values founded in rationality -->
      <p>
        The Web finds its roots in science, and has grown through a predilection for rational
        discourse, non-coercive, open to participation, and discursive. It would be incongruous to
        believe that the beneficent promise of the Web can be realised through the political and
        ethical technology of the pre-scientific ages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Systems which foster concentrated control are from the point of view of technological 
        progress reactionary. Web technology must therefore maximise decentralisation, as must the
        process through which it is produce since any alliance of people, no matter how 
        well-intentioned, will see its abilities residing a long way this side of omniscience and
        omnipotence.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, it is necessary to establish for voluntary associations of the Web's
        constituencies rights which they can enforce agains magnates and majorities, monopolies and
        mobs. Stewardship of the Web must therefore proceed through a venue within which control
        is relinquished as much as it can be, but which can equally foster the cooperation of
        many. Such a framework can prosper because good faith collaboration has ceased to be an
        other-worldly aspiration and become the working doctrine of practical people.
      </p>
      <!--
        - reason as the founding principle for human relations
        - this leads straight to creativity, decentralisation, lack of authority, etc. (plenty
          of material). Sustein on how dissent is critical and generative for society
      -->


      <hr class='partsep'>
      <!-- 3. This is for everyone -->
      <p>
        The Web is universal in its reach and conviction, it is for everyone in a world in which all
        humans are persons and the human person is inviolable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is therefore a goal integral to this organisation that the Web be not just available to
        everyone, but further that it work for everyone irrespective of the individual
        characteristics that may set people apart, that everyone can freely publish to it, both
        safely and with expectations of privacy commensurate with the information which they release
        to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, the Web adheres to and advocates the fundamental tenets of democracy, defined not
        through the logistics of voting — which by themselves offer insufficient guarantees for the
        inviolability of all — but through basic human rights, independent courts to enforce them,
        and free media to monitor them. It is a democracy of proactive inclusiveness, of fierce
        independence, and of ruthless dedication to fair adjudication, including against oneself.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1937, Walter Lippmann wrote that “there are important differences between lions and
        tigers, even between African and Indian lions. But from the point of view of, let us say, a
        goat or a lamb, the common characteristics of all the great carnivores are more significant
        than their differences.” From the point of view of a citizen, the common characteristics of
        those who pry on their safety and privacy are more significant than the differences in their
        purported political aims or business models.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be impossible for the Web to flourish if in doing so it exhausted its resources.
        It is thus undeniable that conservation, in its broadest sense, including in its coverage
        the long-term preservation of the documents we produce, the vernacular documentation of our
        culture, and the natural resources that sustain our technological ecosystem, counts amongst
        our paramount obligations for there is no preservation of the Web that can simultaneously
        destroy the patrimony of our children.
      </p>

      <hr class='partsep'>
      <!-- 4. Enabling Agency -->
      <p>
        In order to reach the Web we want, we must enable agency at a level comparable to the needs
        of the task at hand. The principles outlined here are intentionally simple, the complexity
        of policy having to be inversely proportional to the complexity of the affairs that it
        governs, for while a few things can be directed much, many things can be administered only a
        little.
      </p>
      <p>
        The need for decentralised control outlined above makes it possible for new agents not yet
        established to act decisively within the Web without needing to gain permission or being
        otherwise blocked by established participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with the permission granted by decentralisation and openness, interoperability
        makes it possible for participants to focus on the creative aspects of their work rather 
        than on having to solve lower-level issues time and again in order to deliver worldwide.
        Note that interoperability is naturally something that we strive for at the technological
        level, but is also a feature of the legal system. Regulatory frameworks must as much as
        possible be interoperable at the global level in order to enable the production of services
        that do not need to be repurposed for specific countries, but rather can nimbly be deployed
        world wide. Such a worldwide interoperable deployment framework naturally encompasses
        networks that are neutral with respect to their payloads.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to be effective, this interoperability must come at reasonable cost, and enable
        the creation of powerful, fast programs. It must shield individuals and SMEs from
        inequality in bargaining power and the costs associated with a polity of pressure groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deployed globally, the enabling agency of interoperability will lead to a Web of abundant
        resources exchanged in an open market (by which we don't necessarily mean solely 
        monetarily).
      </p>

      • "The impulse to create and the impulse to be free are cumulative: each is to the other
      both cause and effect." -> creativity
      - abundance comes from making it possible for people to build their own web, from preventing
      any one group from being on the critical path to innovation
      - pervasive technology
      • "The kind of self-education which a self-governing people must obtain can be had only
      through its daily experiences. In other words, a democracy must have a way of life which
      educates the people for the democratic way of life." -> we need to set ourselves up so as
      to ensure that what we do is self-reproducing, education is important in our own actions, not
      as some abstract thing that we hope other people do well

      <!-- 5. Parting Words -->
      <p>
        These principles are not intended to be cast in stone in perpetuity; rather they demand to
        be challenged as often and as virulently as needed. It is our goal to account for frictions
        and disturbances both on the Web and in our actions as a community for those mark the points
        where there is conflict to be overcome, be it social or technological. We strive through
        progressive discovery to civilise ourselves, and this process is by no means completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our overarching goal is for humankind to become adult and to replace paternal authority
        with fraternal association. We simply wish to do our part in committing the destiny of
        civilisation to the whole genius of humankind, to be a free conspiracy to fulfil the 
        promises of our time.
