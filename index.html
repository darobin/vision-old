        It was created based on a brainstorming breakout during Team Day 2013. It is
        an evolving, unofficial, not-particularly-sanctioned, likely-wrong-in-many-places 
        write-up of our collective thinking.

      <p>
        <strong>WARNING</strong>: at this point, all of the content has been written by Robin (hi!)
        and I have made no effort whatsoever to tame the natural tendencies of my writing. The final

      <h2>The Web Society</h2>
      <!-- 1. The endgame of W3C is to disappear -->
      <p>
        An organisation that does not envision and continuously strive to effect a state of the
        world sufficiently aligned with its goals that it will then, having attained its endgame,
        disband and cease its activities of its own accord runs the risk of progressively renouncing
        its ambitions in order solely to perpetuate its own existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such goals may be lofty. They may be far away and hard to reach. The path leading to them
        from the present situation may be murky and strenuous, if it can be seen at all, but the
        destination must be clearly conceived for the organisation to continue applying itself
        towards their realisation and escape the drift towards a self-preservation of the means over
        the ends and its attendant bureaucracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        These goals cannot be solely technical. Technology devoid of social embodiment is at
        best a toy; social aspirations without the technical means to deploy themselves are but
        fantasy. Technology does not create its social counterpart by fiat; and vice versa. A
        harmonious society demands that humankind's tools and laws be crafted in unison. It is
        thus the fundamental objective of the World Wide Web Consortium to steward an unfinished
        revolutionary technology in an incompletely reformed social order until this revolution is
        completed and in accord with its social correlates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The principles laid out henceforth are those we believe must be those of the Web and the
        society in which it unfolds, but also those that our community must exemplify in its own
        behaviour on the way there. They are therefore meant to inform all aspects of our work be
        they technical or organisational, internal to our functioning or exposed externally through
        our contributions to the broader fora of society
      </p>
      
      <hr class='partsep'>
      <!-- 2. Values founded in rationality -->
      <p>
        The Web finds its roots in science, and has grown through a predilection for rational
        discourse, non-coercive, open to participation, and discursive. It would be incongruous to
        believe that the beneficent promise of the Web can be realised through the political and
        ethical technology of the pre-scientific ages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Systems which foster concentrated control are from the point of view of technological 
        progress reactionary. Web technology must therefore maximise decentralisation, as must the
        process through which it is produce since any alliance of people, no matter how 
        well-intentioned, will see its abilities residing a long way this side of omniscience and
        omnipotence.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, it is necessary to establish for voluntary associations of the Web's
        constituencies rights which they can enforce agains magnates and majorities, monopolies and
        mobs. Stewardship of the Web must therefore proceed through a venue within which control
        is relinquished as much as it can be, but which can equally foster the cooperation of
        many. Such a framework can prosper because good faith collaboration has ceased to be an
        other-worldly aspiration and become the working doctrine of practical people.
      </p>
      <!--
      2. Values founded in rationality
        - reason as the founding principle for human relations
        - this leads straight to creativity, decentralisation, lack of authority, etc. (plenty
          of material). Sustein on how dissent is critical and generative for society
      -->

      <hr class='partsep'>
      <!-- 3. This is for everyone -->
      <p>
        The Web is universal in its reach and conviction, it is for everyone in a world in which all
        humans are persons and the human person is inviolable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is therefore a goal integral to this organisation that the Web be not just available to
        everyone, but further that it work for everyone irrespective of the individual
        characteristics that may set people apart, that everyone can freely publish to it, both
        safely and with expectations of privacy commensurate with the information which they release
        to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, the Web adheres to and advocates the fundamental tenets of democracy, defined not
        through the logistics of voting — which by themselves offer insufficient guarantees for the
        inviolability of all — but through basic human rights, independent courts to enforce them,
        and free media to monitor them. It is a democracy of proactive inclusiveness, of fierce
        independence, and of ruthless dedication to fair adjudication, including against oneself.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1937, Walter Lippmann wrote that “there are important differences between lions and
        tigers, even between African and Indian lions. But from the point of view of, let us say, a
        goat or a lamb, the common characteristics of all the great carnivores are more significant
        than their differences.” From the point of view of a citizen, the common characteristics of
        those who pry on their safety and privacy are more significant than the differences in their
        purported political aims or business models.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be impossible for the Web to flourish if in doing so it exhausted its resources.
        It is thus undeniable that conservation, in its broadest sense, including in its coverage
        the long-term preservation of the documents we produce, the vernacular documentation of our
        culture, and the natural resources that sustain our technological ecosystem, counts amongst
        our paramount obligations for there is no preservation of the Web that can simultaneously
        destroy the patrimony of our children.
      </p>

      <!-- 4. Enabling Agency -->
      <p>
        In order to reach the Web we want, we must enable agency at a level comparable to the needs
        of the task at hand.

        NOTES FROM LIPPMANN
        
        Prior to the Industrial Revolution, social relationship were relatively well ordained. The
        advent and continuous increase of the division of labour that stemmed from it was at the
        heart of all the great social issues that followed, and to this day has yet to be matched
        by a sufficient adaptation of our social thinking to our social organisation. The Web, and
        more generally the Internet, by their reticular nature have provided the soil on which to
        rebuild the links amongst people that division of labour had shaken.
        
        • "The problem, as I see it, is how to reconcile with the comparatively new economy of the
        division of labour the great and ancient and progressive traditions of liberty embodied in
        laws which respect the human personality". -> this can be adapted with the Web in mind, as
        part of the intro
        • "For the frictions and disturbances mark the points at which the social order is in 
        conflict with the economy." -> we have some of that
        • "If, as I am arguing, it is the mission of liberalism to discern the guiding principles
        of the transition from the primitive way of life in relatively self-contained communities to
        a way of life in a Great Society of interdependent specialists, then liberalism is concerned
        with nothing less than a re-adaptation of the human race to a new mode of existence."
        -> we must take that into account
        • "The kind of self-education which a self-governing people must obtain can be had only
        through its daily experiences. In other words, a democracy must have a way of life which
        educates the people for the democratic way of life." -> we need to set ourselves up so as
        to ensure that what we do is self-reproducing
        • "Truly conceived, a democracy is not the government of a people by elected representatives
        exercising the prerogatives of their former lords and masters. It is the government of the
        people by a common law which defines the reciprocal rights and duties of persons. This
        common law is defined, applies, and amended by the representatives of the people." -> can
        this somehow apply?
        • "The manifest destiny of mankind is to become adult and to replace paternal authority
        with fraternal association." -> This seems to be part of the plan.
        • "The business of the state must be based on an understanding of the limitations of 
        coercive authority; the art of governing must call for not more than the ordinarily 
        available wisdom of average men. (...) There are few supermen. There has never been a
        succession of supermen." This is related to freedom and governance.
        • "So the liberal state does not have to be supremely wise. That is more than a state can
        hope to be: the liberal state has only to create a sincere conviction that it means to be
        fair." -> s/liberal state/Consortium/
        • "The conception of equal and certain laws is the political corollary of the division of 
        labour."
        • "To those who ask where this higher law is to be found, the answer is that it is a
        progressive discovery of men striving to civilise themselves, and that its scope and 
        implications are a gradual revelation that is by no means completed." -> nice helper part
        for the section on the endgame? or maybe the conclusion?
        • "Liberalism commits the destiny of civilisation, not to a few finite politicians here and
        there, but to the whole genius of mankind." -> I like "the whole genius"
        
        
        From GOOD FAITH COLLABORATION
        
        • "When those subject to bureaucratic control seek to escape the influence of the existing
        bureaucratic apparatus, this is normally possible only by creating an organization of their
        own which is equally subject to bureaucratization." 16 It seems as if Weber was speaking of
        forking over a century ago. -> yeah man
        • "In his book Surowiecki argues that groups of people can make very good decisions when
        there is diversity, independence, decentralization, and appropriate aggregation within the
        group."
        • "It is true that civility as I characterize it is related to mutual respect, but there is
        a crucial difference: genuine respect is too strong a value to demand ... in a deeply
        pluralistic society. The relative advantage of civility is that it does not ask participants
        to do anything more than treat political interlocutors as if they were worthy of respect and
        understanding, keeping their private thoughts to themselves."
        • "Cass Sunstein convincingly argues that dissent is a critical and generative contribution
        to society."
